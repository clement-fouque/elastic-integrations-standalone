### Technical Details

#### Service Configuration
- Elasticsearch: 512MB heap, single-node discovery, security disabled
- Kibana: Fleet enabled, encryption key configured
- Fleet Server: Insecure HTTP mode for testing, auto-setup with Kibana
- Elastic Agent: Root user for system access, Docker socket mounted
- NGINX: Custom configuration with health endpoint

#### Port Mappings
- 9200: Elasticsearch
- 5601: Kibana
- 8220: Fleet Server
- 8080: NGINX Sample

#### Networks
- `elastic`: Bridge network for all services

#### Volumes
- `elasticsearch-data`: Persistent Elasticsearch data
- `nginx-logs`: NGINX log files

### Development Notes

This initial release provides a complete, production-ready development/testing environment for Elastic Agent integrations. The setup is designed to be:

- **Easy to use**: Single command setup (`./scripts/setup.sh`)
- **Well-documented**: Comprehensive documentation for all use cases
- **Flexible**: Easy to extend with new services and integrations
- **Reliable**: Health checks ensure proper startup
- **Maintainable**: Clean code structure and modular design

### Known Limitations

- Security features are disabled (for development/testing only)
- Single-node Elasticsearch (not suitable for production)
- Uses default service tokens (should be changed for production)
- Requires at least 4GB RAM for optimal performance

### Compatibility

- Docker 20.10+
- Docker Compose v2.0+
- Linux, macOS, Windows (with WSL2)
- Tested with Elastic Stack 8.11.0

### Next Steps

Future enhancements could include:

- [ ] Multiple Elastic Stack versions support
- [ ] Security-enabled configuration option
- [ ] Multi-node Elasticsearch cluster option
- [ ] Additional integration examples (MySQL, PostgreSQL, Apache, etc.)
- [ ] Monitoring and alerting examples
- [ ] APM (Application Performance Monitoring) integration
- [ ] Automated tests with CI/CD
- [ ] Kubernetes deployment option
